SentimentAnalysis Using J2EE, Hadoop and NLP

System Architecture Overview:
The words that people use to express their opinion are positive, negative or neutral. To find the semantic orientation of the opinion words in tweets, we propose a novel hybrid approach and dictionary-based techniques. We also consider features like emoticons and capitalization as they have recently become a large part of the cyber language.  To uncover the opinion direction, we will first extract the opinion words in the tweets and then find out their orientation, i.e., to decide whether each opinion word reflects a positive sentiment, negative sentiment or a neutral sentiment. In our work, we are considering the opinion words as the combination of the adjectives along with the verbs and adverbs. The corpus-based method is then used to find the semantic orientation of adjectives and the dictionary-based method is employed to find the semantic orientation of verbs and adverbs.
